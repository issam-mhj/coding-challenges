/**
 * 🏆 Challenge: Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light (8kyu)
 *
 * 📝 Description:
You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

 */

function updateLight(current) {
  if (current == "green") {
    return "yellow";
  } else if (current == "yellow") {
    return "red";
  } else {
    return "green";
  }
}

// Test cases
const chai = require("chai");
const assert = chai.assert;
chai.config.truncateThreshold = 0;

describe("Basic tests", () => {
  it("Testing for fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(updateLight("green"), "yellow");
    assert.strictEqual(updateLight("yellow"), "red");
    assert.strictEqual(updateLight("red"), "green");
  });
});
